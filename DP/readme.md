#### Binomial Recurrance Formula

**(n,k) = (n-1, k-1) + (n-1,k)**

> while choosing a subset from an n element set there are two ways

* either include n in the subset
* do not include n in the subset


> in first case if n is included then there are (n-1) spots to fill and (k-1) elements to choose **(n-1, k-1)**

> in second case if n is not included then there are (n-1) spots to fill and (k) elements to choose  **(n-1, k)**
