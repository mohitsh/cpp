You have an empty sequence, and you will be given queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x  -Push the element x into the stack.
2    -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3    -Print the maximum element in the stack.


For each type query, print the maximum element in the stack on a new line.
