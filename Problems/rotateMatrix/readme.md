# Left Rotate Matrix

Given a Matrix of size M x N. Your task is to print the matrix K times left rotated.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of 3 integers, M, N, K. Second line of every test case consists of M*N spaced integers.

Output:
Single line output, print the M*N spaced integer rotated K times.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=M,N,K<=100

Example:
Input:
1
2 2 1
1 2 3 4
Output:
2 1 4 3
