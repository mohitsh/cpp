Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.

Input:
The first line contains 'T' denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases.
Each case begins with a single positive integer N denoting the size of array.
The second line contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A.

Output:
For each testcase, print "Yes" or  "No" whtether it is Pythagorean Triplet or not.

Constraints:
1<=T<=50
 1<=N<=100
 1<=A[i]<=100

Example:
Input:
1
5
3 2 4 6 5
Output:
Yes
