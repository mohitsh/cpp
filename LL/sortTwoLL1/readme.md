Merging two already sorted Linked List (Method1)
1. insertNodeAtBack() adds new nodes 
2. mergeSortedLL() merges both linked list
3. displayL() prints the LinkedList data
4. appendNode() appends new node while creating the merged LinkedList

Here, a fresh LinkedList is generated while traversing both
the LinkedList simultaneously and appending the nodes in increasing order.
